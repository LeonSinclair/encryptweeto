- Use the Twitter API to send encrypted tweets and non encrypted DMs - This is fairly done 
- Use TTY to manage everything
- JSON File full of Group Name : Keys
- Delete people from groups 
- Add people to groups
- Previous two done ideally via user name 
- When you add someone to a group, it DMs them the key 
- When you delete someone from a group, it generates a new key and DMs the others in the group the new key
- Groups can be an array of user names with the first entry being the key and then the names, name of the group is
    the hash key - may do first entry is public key and second entry is private key 
- Get Tweet ID and decrypt it 
- Use OpenSSL to generate keys?
- Public and Private Key system?




- Flow ->
    Ask User what operation they'd like to perform ->
        Generate Key 
        Add User to Group - Takes User and Group, sends Group Key to the User 
        Delete User from Group - Removes User from Group, creates new Group Key and sends to all other Users
        Send Encrypted Direct Message - Takes in DM Text and Group Name and sends using key from that Group 
        Send Encrypted Tweet - Takes in Tweet Text and Group Name and sends using key from that Group 
        Create Group - Takes Group Name and generates Keys, stores in first part of array
        Delete Group - Deletes everything in the group 
    Make Changes as Needed
    Repeat


    Will also need a decryption app that can take in text and a key and spit out the right answer
    or else a decryption option that can decrypt using a given key 

- How do we store our group data? ->
    Store in a file, possibly JSON
